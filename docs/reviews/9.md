# Review: Issue #9 - Map DAP continue/next/stepIn/stepOut/pause to RIDE controls

## Summary

Implementation is aligned with plan sections 4 and 9. DAP control commands now map to expected RIDE controls with guardrails for lifecycle state, active tracer window requirements, and a pause fallback hook path when `WeakInterrupt` fails.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: request argument parsing and per-thread control targeting are not implemented yet, which is acceptable for this phase and should be expanded in upcoming thread/stack issues.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./...`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
