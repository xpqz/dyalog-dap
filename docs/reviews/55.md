# Review: Issue #55 - Define and implement live CI matrix for Dyalog compatibility

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by adding a concrete live compatibility matrix workflow, documenting fast/slow gate and self-hosted strategy, and enforcing optional release-readiness gating against recent live-matrix signal.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: live matrix execution reliability still depends on external self-hosted runner health and profile configuration; this is documented with metrics/artifact capture for diagnosis.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
