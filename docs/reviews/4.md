# Review: Issue #4 - Implement typed RIDE command codec with tolerant unknown handling

## Summary

Second-pass implementation review after fixes: the earlier typed-decode gap is resolved, and I found no correctness, regression, or API-contract issues that should block merge. The codec now decodes known phase-1 commands into typed models, preserves tolerant handling for unknown commands and malformed/non-JSON payloads, and keeps behavior aligned with the plan.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: unit coverage is good for the codec boundary, but live Dyalog integration tests are still needed in subsequent issues to validate command ordering and runtime behavior beyond payload parsing.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./...`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/ride/protocol/codec.go internal/ride/protocol/codec_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
