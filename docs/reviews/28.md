# Review: Issue #28 - Add integration tests for breakpoint persistence and save-close ordering

## Summary

Implementation meets issue scope by adding composed integration assertions for breakpoint translation and save/close ordering semantics at the protocol boundary.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: live interpreter persistence behavior across reconnect/restart remains out of scope and should be validated in later live integration stages.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/integration/harness/harness_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
