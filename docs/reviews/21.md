# Review: Issue #21 - Validate undocumented commands across target Dyalog versions

## Summary

Implementation meets the in-repo validation scope for issue #21 by codifying the targeted undocumented command subset in protocol decoding, covering it with tests, and documenting reference evidence from both RIDE and gritt sources.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: live multi-version Dyalog matrix execution is not performed in this task context and remains deferred to integration-harness issues.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/ride/protocol/codec.go internal/ride/protocol/codec_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
