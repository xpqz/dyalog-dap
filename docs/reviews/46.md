# Review: Issue #46 - Convert extension scaffold to TypeScript source/build pipeline

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and context references by introducing a TypeScript extension source/build/test baseline, preserving existing adapter launch behavior, and adding CI enforcement for extension package quality gates.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: this issue adds helper-level unit coverage and package pipeline checks, but full VS Code host integration contract testing is still tracked separately (issue #49).

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Extension package checks: pass (`npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` in `vscode-extension/`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
