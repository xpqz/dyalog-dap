# Review: Issue #23 - Implement interrupt strategy with WeakInterrupt and StrongInterrupt fallback

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope for pause fallback strategy and telemetry. The adapter now applies a deterministic weak->strong->hook interrupt chain and reports the winning mechanism via response body.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: fallback-hook failure paths are still reported with coarse error messaging and do not include structured cause detail.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
