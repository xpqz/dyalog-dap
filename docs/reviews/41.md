# Review: Issue #41 - Add runtime lifecycle hardening for launched interpreter ownership

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and plan sections 3, 7, and 10. Runtime teardown now avoids the disconnect hang path, ownership policy is explicit (`launch` owns process lifecycle, `attach` is connect-only), and regression tests protect both stuck-session shutdown and attach ownership misconfiguration.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: timeout diagnostics are now present at runtime-stop boundaries, but there is no dedicated deterministic unit test that forces `waitForDone` timeout paths; this is acceptable for current scope because the main deadlock regression is covered end-to-end.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation
