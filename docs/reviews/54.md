# Review: Issue #54 - Create end-to-end interactive debug automation against live Dyalog

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by adding an adapter-bound live interactive E2E workflow test, deterministic artifact capture, explicit flake classification policy, and CI wiring for optional enforced execution in live-capable environments.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: workflow correctness still depends on external live environment determinism (launch behavior and stopped-event preconditions), but this is now explicitly classified and diagnosable via artifacts.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
