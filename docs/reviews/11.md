# Review: Issue #11 - Implement DAP threads request backed by GetThreads

## Summary

Implementation meets issue scope and plan sections 5 and 9. The adapter now polls RIDE via `GetThreads` on DAP `threads` requests, updates cache from `ReplyGetThreads`, and returns stable DAP thread IDs with deterministic ordering.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: `threads` currently returns the latest cache immediately after polling, so first-call freshness still depends on asynchronous `ReplyGetThreads` arrival timing.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./...`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
