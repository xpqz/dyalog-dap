# Review: Issue #6 - Add timestamped protocol traffic logging for diagnostics

## Summary

Implementation review is clean. The transport now supports opt-in structured timestamped inbound/outbound logging, and tests cover both traffic directions plus JSONL output structure. The changes conform to the plan's diagnostics requirement without altering default behavior when logging is not enabled.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: logging is synchronous on the transport read/write path, so very slow logger sinks can impact throughput when enabled; this is acceptable for diagnostics mode but should be considered in integration harness configuration.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./...`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/ride/transport/client.go internal/ride/transport/client_test.go internal/ride/transport/traffic_log.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
