# Review: Issue #61 - Add adapter install/update workflow in VS Code extension

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria. The extension now provides an installer command that downloads platform-matched release assets, verifies checksums, extracts binaries into extension-managed storage, and reuses that installed path during adapter launch fallback.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: installer reliability still depends on external GitHub API/asset availability and release naming consistency; failure paths are explicit and fail closed.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`, `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`, `cd vscode-extension && npm run test:exthost`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`, TypeScript lint/build)
- Additional validation: live installer smoke run against current GitHub release succeeded
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
