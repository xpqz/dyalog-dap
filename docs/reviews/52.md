# Review: Issue #52 - Harden source lifecycle consistency across window/mapping changes

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by defining and enforcing deterministic source precedence, invalidating stale in-memory text on mapping churn/close events, and adding lifecycle tests that protect against cross-bound source content regressions.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: diagnostics are currently response-message based; separate structured output-event diagnostics could still be added later if required by tooling.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
