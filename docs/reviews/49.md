# Review: Issue #49 - Add extension contract tests for adapter launch and config mapping

## Summary

Implementation meets issue scope by introducing a dedicated contract layer for debug configuration and adapter launch mapping, extending platform-specific adapter path coverage, and adding explicit CI gating for extension contract tests.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: runtime behavior in VS Code host is now contract-tested at module level, but full host-level activation/integration tests (Extension Development Host automation) remain a separate scope.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Extension contract gate: pass (`npm run test:contracts` in `vscode-extension/`)
- Extension package checks: pass (`npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` in `vscode-extension/`)
- VSIX packaging: pass (`npm run package:vsix` in `vscode-extension/`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
