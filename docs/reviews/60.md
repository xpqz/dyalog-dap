# Review: Issue #60 - Add VS Code Extension Host integration tests for extension workflows

## Summary

Implementation meets issue scope and acceptance criteria. The repository now includes an Extension Host harness, a real runtime test for `dyalogDap.generateDiagnosticBundle`, CI execution for that flow, and contributor docs for local/CI usage.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: Extension Host tests depend on VS Code download/runtime startup, so CI runtime/availability can affect signal latency.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`, `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`, `cd vscode-extension && npm run test:exthost`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`, TypeScript lint/build)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
