# Review: Issue #27 - Add integration tests for tracer lifecycle and stepping controls

## Summary

Implementation meets issue scope with composed integration coverage for tracer lifecycle and stepping controls, and it correctly addresses the newly uncovered transport full-duplex lock contention bug.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: live interpreter debugger behavior remains to be validated in future live-Dyalog integration runs.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/integration/harness/harness_test.go internal/ride/transport/client.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
