# Review: Issue #32 - Add DAP protocol tests for initialize/threads/stack/step/continue/breakpoints

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by adding deterministic adapter-level DAP phase-1 flow coverage across initialize/threads/stack/step/continue/breakpoint paths.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: this flow focuses on happy-path sequencing; complex concurrent/error-edge protocol flows continue to rely on targeted tests.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/protocol_flow_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
