# Review: Issue #72 - Extract runtime config + DAP transport from cmd/dap-adapter/main.go

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria. Runtime config parsing and DAP framing are extracted into dedicated packages, and command-level behavior remains validated by existing tests.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: edge-case coverage for malformed DAP headers is still basic and can be expanded in future transport-focused hardening.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./internal/dap/transport ./internal/runtime/config ./cmd/dap-adapter -count=1`, `go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
