# Review: Issue #10 - Emit DAP stopped events from tracer lifecycle transitions

## Summary

Implementation is aligned with issue goals and plan sections 4 and 9. The adapter now emits DAP `stopped` events from key tracer lifecycle transitions and maintains active window/thread selection state for downstream control and stack operations.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: stopped-event payload is intentionally minimal in this phase; richer reason/details and stack-aware context will need expansion as thread/stack endpoints are implemented.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./...`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
