# Review: Issue #51 - Expand evaluate semantics for watch, hover, and repl contexts

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by defining deterministic evaluate behavior per context, adding a practical repl fallback path when ValueTip is insufficient, and improving timeout/error translation to avoid hanging semantics.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: repl fallback is intentionally scoped to simple symbol expressions from cache; richer expression fallback (non-symbol debug-eval) remains future work.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
