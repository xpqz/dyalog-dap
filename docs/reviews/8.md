# Review: Issue #8 - Implement DAP server bootstrap and capability negotiation

## Summary

Implementation is aligned with issue scope and plan section 9. The server now exposes a clear bootstrap lifecycle skeleton (`initialize`, `launch/attach`, `configurationDone`, `disconnect/terminate`), emits `initialized`, and negotiates phase-1 capabilities in a DAP-compatible initialize response body.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: this issue intentionally stops at in-process lifecycle logic; full DAP wire-protocol transport handling and runtime request mappings remain for subsequent issues.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./...`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
