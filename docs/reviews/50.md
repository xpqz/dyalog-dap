# Review: Issue #50 - Implement practical locals and variable inspection model

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by introducing a RIDE-aligned symbol/value inspection path that surfaces practical `locals`/`globals` categories, preserves frame metadata, and adds expandable truncation/pagination behavior for large values.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: symbol extraction is heuristic (header/assignment-based) and may miss edge-case APL naming patterns; this is acceptable for current scope and covered by deterministic adapter tests for the implemented strategy.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
