# Review: Issue #33 - Define CI test matrix and gating for unit/integration/DAP suites

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by introducing a clear CI gating strategy with mandatory critical/full test jobs and an explicit optional live-Dyalog path conditioned on endpoint availability.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: live-Dyalog job reliability depends on external endpoint provisioning and runner/network stability outside this repository.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: not applicable (YAML + tested Go source)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
