# Review: Issue #12 - Implement DAP stackTrace using tracer token model

## Summary

Implementation matches issue scope and plan sections 5 and 9. Stack frames are now constructed from tracer windows/tokens with stable frame IDs and top-frame ordering, and `ReplyGetSIStack` descriptions are used as optional enrichment.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: stack-frame source metadata and richer SI alignment heuristics are still pending follow-up work.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./...`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
