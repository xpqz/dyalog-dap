# Review: Issue #63 - Add diagnostics-first support intake template and bundle summarizer

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria. Support intake now has a diagnostics-first issue template, and maintainers can run a single command to summarize bundle JSON into first-pass classification and action guidance.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: summary classification is heuristic and may need tuning as new diagnostic event names are introduced.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`, `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`, `cd vscode-extension && npm run test:exthost`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`, TypeScript lint/build)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
