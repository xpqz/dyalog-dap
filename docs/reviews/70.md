# Review: Issue #70 - Create shared decode utility and migrate duplicate adapter/runtime helpers

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria. A shared decode utility package now centralizes conversion behavior, and migrated runtime/adapter/protocol call sites remain test-green.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: conversion edge cases outside current test fixtures may still emerge in new payload shapes and should be added to decode package tests when encountered.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./internal/support/decode ./internal/ride/protocol ./internal/dap/adapter ./cmd/dap-adapter -count=1`, `go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
