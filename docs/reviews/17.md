# Review: Issue #17 - Handle breakpoints when target source is not yet open

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and plan section 9 risk mitigation. Breakpoints targeting unmapped sources are now deferred, `GetWindowLayout` sync is requested on demand, and deferred entries are applied when source-window mappings become available.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: late breakpoint verification is applied at the RIDE layer, but no DAP `breakpoint` event is emitted to notify the client when previously unverified breakpoints become active.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
