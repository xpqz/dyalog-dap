# Review: Issue #47 - Add VSIX packaging and extension release automation

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and context references by adding reproducible VSIX packaging scripts, a tag-driven extension artifact workflow, and release/compatibility documentation tied to adapter usage.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: Marketplace publication remains intentionally manual (credentials/process), but this is documented and aligned with the issue acceptance criteria.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Extension package checks: pass (`npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` in `vscode-extension/`)
- VSIX packaging: pass (`npm run package:vsix` in `vscode-extension/`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
