# Review: Issue #68 - Split scaffold tests into domain files with shared helpers

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria. The scaffold suite is now domain-split with shared helper utilities, and behavioral intent is preserved.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: changes are structural and assertion-preserving; residual risk is limited to future discoverability drift if new scaffold tests are added without consistent domain placement.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -run '^TestScaffold_' -count=1`, `go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
