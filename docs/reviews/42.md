# Review: Issue #42 - Implement DAP evaluate and source requests

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and the referenced plan sections with phase-appropriate behavior: `evaluate` now uses correlated `GetValueTip`/`ValueTip`, `source` serves mapped source content, and prompt-state/error translation paths are covered by tests.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: evaluate currently requires an active tracer/frame context and does not yet implement full REPL execute-stream evaluation semantics; this is documented and acceptable for current phase scope.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
