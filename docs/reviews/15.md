# Review: Issue #15 - Implement setBreakpoints translation to SetLineAttributes

## Summary

Implementation is aligned with issue scope and plan sections 4, 8, and 9. `setBreakpoints` is now translated from DAP source/line form into RIDE `SetLineAttributes` window/0-based line form, with explicit unmapped-source handling and regression coverage.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: this issue intentionally does not persist breakpoints through `SaveChanges` and does not queue breakpoints for sources not yet mapped to an open RIDE token.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
