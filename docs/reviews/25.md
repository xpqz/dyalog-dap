# Review: Issue #25 - Create integration harness to launch/connect Dyalog and capture protocol logs

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by introducing reusable harness utilities and verified per-test transcript artifact generation, while keeping live-Dyalog dependencies optional.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: launch-process lifecycle behavior is basic and may require hardening for more complex external process supervision scenarios.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/integration/harness/harness.go internal/integration/harness/harness_test.go internal/ride/transport/client.go internal/ride/transport/client_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
