# Review: Issue #48 - Add guided setup commands and diagnostics UX in extension

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by adding command-driven setup/validation UX, structured extension diagnostics with a verbosity toggle, and actionable adapter startup remediation guidance.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: `validateRideAddr` currently validates syntax/range only and does not probe network reachability, which is acceptable for this issue scope and can be extended later.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Extension package checks: pass (`npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` in `vscode-extension/`)
- VSIX packaging: pass (`npm run package:vsix` in `vscode-extension/`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
