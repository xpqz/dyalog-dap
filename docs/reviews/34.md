# Review: Issue #34 - Document implementation assumptions and plan traceability

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope with an explicit assumptions + traceability matrix tied to plan sections, implementation files, verification evidence, and documented validated deviations.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: matrix freshness still depends on process discipline as functionality evolves; current scaffold check enforces structure/presence, not semantic currency.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: not applicable (markdown + tested Go source)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
