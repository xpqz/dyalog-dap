# Review: Issue #71 - Introduce outbound intent pattern and remove I/O-under-lock in migrated adapter paths

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria for migrated paths. Deferred-breakpoint outbound sends now execute after lock release through an explicit intent model, and regression coverage demonstrates non-deadlocking re-entrant send callback behavior.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: the intent model is currently applied to deferred-breakpoint paths only; additional send paths should migrate in follow-up issues for full lock/I-O boundary consistency.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./internal/dap/adapter -run 'DeferredApplyExecutesSendOutsideLock|OpenWindowAppliesDeferredBreakpoints|UpdateWindowAppliesDeferredBreakpointsWithConsistentLineTranslation' -count=1`, `go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
