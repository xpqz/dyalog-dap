# Review: Issue #26 - Add integration tests for handshake and execute prompt transitions

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope with deterministic integration assertions for startup sequence and execute prompt-transition completion behavior through harness+dispatcher flow.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: coverage still uses fake-server protocol simulation; live interpreter behavior across versions remains to be validated by later integration issues.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/integration/harness/harness_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
