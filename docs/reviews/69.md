# Review: Issue #69 - Refactor extension entrypoint into activation/commands/diagnostics modules

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria. The extension entrypoint has been decomposed into focused modules for activation wiring, command handlers, debug descriptor construction, and diagnostics logging without changing command identifiers.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: module-boundary regressions could still occur in live Extension Host interactions beyond unit/integration command harnesses.

## Verification

- Go tests: pass (`go test ./... -run '^TestScaffold_HasVSCodeExtension|^TestScaffold_HasExtension' -count=1`, `go test ./... -count=1`)
- Extension checks: pass (`cd vscode-extension && npm run lint`, `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`, `cd vscode-extension && npm run build`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (TypeScript compiler output and Go formatting unchanged)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go/TypeScript repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
