# Review: Issue #59 - Define beta-readiness gates and public support matrix

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria. Beta-readiness policy is documented, README now exposes a user-facing support matrix, and scaffold checks enforce continued presence of both.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: policy content accuracy still depends on periodic manual updates as release practices evolve.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`, `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`, TypeScript lint/build)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
