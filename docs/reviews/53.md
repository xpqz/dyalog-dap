# Review: Issue #53 - Improve breakpoint verification feedback and deferred state handling

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope by adding explicit breakpoint verification messages, emitting breakpoint lifecycle diagnostics as DAP output events, and extending deferred/remap test coverage for reliable convergence.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: diagnostics are textual output events; future structured breakpoint telemetry/events can build on this if finer client-side filtering is needed.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
