# Review: Issue #36 - Harden harness shutdown to avoid orphaned Dyalog processes

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and plan sections 10 and 11. Harness-launched processes now use safer lifecycle handling with Unix process-group isolation and terminate/kill escalation, plus regression coverage for background-child cleanup behavior.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: Windows process-tree semantics remain fallback-level (`Process.Kill`) and do not currently include full descendant-tree termination guarantees beyond direct process handling.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt` applied to changed Go files)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
