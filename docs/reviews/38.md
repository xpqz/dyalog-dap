# Review: Issue #38 - Implement minimal VS Code extension to launch dap-adapter

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and plan sections 9 and 10. The repository now contains a concrete VS Code debugger contribution (`dyalog-dap`) with adapter launch wiring, schema-backed launch/attach settings, and scaffold tests protecting extension presence and baseline metadata.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: extension behavior is validated structurally in Go scaffold tests, but UI-level integration automation in Extension Development Host remains outside this issue scope.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (Go files gofmt-compatible; extension files are static JSON/JS)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
