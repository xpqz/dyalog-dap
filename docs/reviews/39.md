# Review: Issue #39 - Add stdio end-to-end DAP session integration tests

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and plan section 10 by extending deterministic stdio session coverage, adding a live adapter-stdio smoke test, and wiring both harness and adapter live paths into optional CI execution.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: live adapter test remains smoke-level (`initialize/launch/threads/disconnect`) and does not assert full tracer-step-breakpoint behavior against real interpreters across version matrix.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (Go files gofmt-compatible)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
