# Review: Issue #14 - Build source-to-window token registry and lifecycle tracking

## Summary

Implementation meets issue scope and plan sections 4 and 9. Source-reference/token registry behavior is now explicit and lifecycle-driven, with stable source references per path, rebinding support, and cleanup on close.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: path normalization/canonicalization is not yet implemented, so equivalent paths with different string forms would currently map to different source references.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./...`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
