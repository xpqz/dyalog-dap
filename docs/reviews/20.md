# Review: Issue #20 - Implement reconnect flow with GetWindowLayout-based restoration

## Summary

Implementation meets issue scope and plan sections 2 and 7. The adapter now has a reconnect lifecycle hook that resets transient runtime state, requests layout restoration through `GetWindowLayout`, and supports rebuilding mappings from subsequent window events.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: reconnect orchestration is still hook-driven and not yet wired end-to-end through transport/session supervisor flows.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
