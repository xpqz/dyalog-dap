# Review: Issue #57 - Add VS Code integration test coverage for diagnostic bundle command

## Summary

Implementation satisfies scope and acceptance criteria. The new integration test activates the extension with a VS Code runtime stub, invokes `dyalogDap.generateDiagnosticBundle`, and verifies artifact creation, expected bundle sections, and redaction behavior.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: integration path depends on Node module-loader stubbing (`Module._load`), which is stable in current CI/runtime but is still a private API surface.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`, `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`, TypeScript compile/lint)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
