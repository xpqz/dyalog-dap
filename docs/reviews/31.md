# Review: Issue #31 - Add VS Code launch/debug smoke configuration for local adapter runs

## Summary

Implementation meets issue scope by adding workspace-level VS Code smoke launch/tasks and validating their presence/shape through scaffold tests.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: this validates config files, not actual IDE extension/runtime availability in each developer environment.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: not applicable (JSON + tested Go source)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
