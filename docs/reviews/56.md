# Review: Issue #56 - Add diagnostic bundle and support triage workflow

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and acceptance criteria: VS Code now exposes a single diagnostic bundle command, bundle payloads are redacted and written as shareable artifacts, and support first-pass triage workflow is documented. I found and fixed one privacy-risk detail during review (environment snapshot scope and PAT redaction matching), then re-ran validation.

## Findings

No remaining findings.

Residual risk/test gap: command-level behavior is currently validated indirectly (unit + scaffold checks) rather than via a VS Code integration test harness that executes `dyalogDap.generateDiagnosticBundle` end-to-end.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`, `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`, TypeScript compile/lint)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
