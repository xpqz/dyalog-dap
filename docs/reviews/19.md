# Review: Issue #19 - Implement robust handling for Disconnect/SysError/InternalError/UnknownCommand

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and plan sections 3 and 7. Adapter now translates critical RIDE diagnostics into explicit DAP output/termination behavior with deterministic session state transitions.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: recovery/reconnect behavior after fatal payloads remains out of scope here and is still deferred to reconnect-focused issues.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt -l internal/dap/adapter/server.go internal/dap/adapter/server_test.go`)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
