# Review: Issue #35 - Wire cmd/dap-adapter into long-running stdio DAP server

## Summary

Implementation satisfies issue scope and plan sections 2, 4, 5, 9, and 10. The command entrypoint is now a functional DAP stdio server with request/response/event framing, runtime startup on launch/attach, RIDE event bridging, and regression tests that validate round-trip behavior through the process boundary.

## Findings

No findings.

Residual risk/test gap: asynchronous event emission from the RIDE bridge currently treats write failures as best-effort (events dropped on write failure), which is acceptable for current scope but should be revisited if stronger delivery/error guarantees are required.

## Verification

- Tests: pass (`go test ./... -count=1`)
- Vet: clean (`go vet ./...`)
- Format: clean (`gofmt`-compatible Go files; no formatting drift observed)
- Clippy: not applicable (Go repository)

## Recommendation

Approve
