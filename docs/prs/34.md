# PR Description - Issue #34

Issue: #34 - Document implementation assumptions and plan traceability  
Branch: codex/34-document-implementation-assumptions-and-plan-traceability  
Plan reference: /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/plans/ride-protocol.md (sections 11 and 12, with cross-references to 1-10)

## Summary

This change adds a dedicated traceability document that maps implemented features to explicit assumptions, plan sections, and verification evidence, including validated deviations from earlier planning assumptions.

## Why this change

The project needed a durable, reviewable map from implementation to plan intent, with explicit documentation of where behavior was assumed, validated, or intentionally deviated.

## Scope of changes

Files changed:

- /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/traceability/assumptions.md
- /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_test.go

Implemented in `assumptions.md`:

- plan-reference index
- explicit assumption list
- feature traceability matrix with:
  - feature
  - plan section mapping
  - key assumptions
  - implementation evidence (file paths)
  - verification evidence (tests/docs)
- validated deviations section

Implemented in `scaffold_test.go`:

- `TestScaffold_HasAssumptionsTraceabilityDoc`
  - validates traceability doc presence and required section headers

## Test coverage

Added scaffold-level regression protection so the assumptions/traceability document remains present and structurally complete.

## Validation performed

Commands run:

- `go test ./... -count=1`
- `go vet ./...`

Result:

- all tests pass
- vet clean

## Compatibility and risk

Behavior notes:

- plan-to-implementation traceability is now explicit and centrally maintained
- known deviations are documented alongside evidence rather than implicit in PR history

Known limitations in this PR:

- matrix entries summarize current implementation and must be kept current as future capabilities evolve

## Out of scope

Not part of this PR:

- automated generation of traceability matrix from issue tracker metadata
- policy enforcement for matrix freshness beyond scaffold presence checks
