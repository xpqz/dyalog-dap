# PR Description - Issue #59

Issue: #59 - Define beta-readiness gates and public support matrix  
Branch: codex/59-define-beta-readiness-gates-and-public-support-matrix  
Plan reference: /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/plans/ride-protocol.md (validation rigor and production-facing confidence)  
Context references: /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/validations/55-live-ci-matrix.md, /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/README.md, parent epic #58

## Summary

This change defines explicit beta readiness policy, release gates, and a public support matrix for users and maintainers.

## Why this change

With prior core implementation epics complete, we need a clear contract for what "beta-ready" means, what must pass before release, and what platform/version coverage users can rely on.

## Scope of changes

Files changed:

- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/validations/beta-readiness.md`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/README.md`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_test.go`

### Beta readiness policy document

Added `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/validations/beta-readiness.md` with:

- explicit beta goals
- release gate policy (core, live, supportability, distribution)
- public support matrix (Dyalog/OS/VS Code targets)
- required runtime coverage and evidence artifact expectations

### README support matrix section

Added `Beta Readiness and Support Matrix` section to README, including:

- link to the policy document
- concise user-facing matrix targets
- release gate summary bullets

### Scaffold guard

Added `TestScaffold_HasBetaReadinessPolicyAndSupportMatrix` to enforce:

- policy document existence and key content
- README contains beta/support matrix references

## Validation performed

Commands run:

- `go test ./... -count=1`
- `go vet ./...`
- `cd vscode-extension && npm run lint`
- `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`
- `cd vscode-extension && npm run build`

Result:

- all checks pass

## Compatibility and risk

Behavioral impact:

- documentation/scaffold only; no runtime protocol or adapter behavior changes

Risk:

- low. Main risk is policy drift over time; scaffold guard prevents silent removal.

## Reviewer guide

Suggested review order:

1. `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/validations/beta-readiness.md`
2. `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/README.md`
3. `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_test.go`
