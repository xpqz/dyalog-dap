Issue: #62 - Harden release workflow and user-facing release notes  
Branch: codex/62-harden-release-workflow-and-user-facing-release-notes  
Plan reference: /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/plans/ride-protocol.md (productization and validation guardrails)  
Context references: /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/releases/extension-vsix.md, /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/README.md, parent epic #58

## Summary

This change adds release documentation standards and CI release-metadata validation so published releases consistently include checksums and installation guidance.

## Why this change

Issue #62 requires moving release mechanics from maintainer memory to enforceable policy so users get predictable install/upgrade guidance and integrity metadata.

## Scope of changes

Files changed:

- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/releases/release-checklist.md`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/releases/release-notes-template.md`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_test.go`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/README.md`

### Release checklist doc

Added `docs/releases/release-checklist.md` with explicit adapter artifacts, extension artifacts, checksums, install guidance, and supportability checks.

### Release notes template

Added `docs/releases/release-notes-template.md` with required sections:

- highlights
- installation (with install links)
- checksums
- compatibility
- support

### CI release metadata validation

Updated `release.yml` with `Validate release artifact metadata` step that fails release job when:

- `dist/checksums.txt` is missing/empty
- release-notes template missing required installation/checksum content
- install instructions link pattern is absent

### Scaffold guard

Added scaffold coverage for:

- release checklist file content
- release-notes template content
- release workflow metadata validation snippets

## Validation performed

Commands run:

- `go test ./... -count=1`
- `go vet ./...`
- `cd vscode-extension && npm run lint`
- `cd vscode-extension && npm test -- --runInBand`
- `cd vscode-extension && npm run test:exthost`
- `cd vscode-extension && npm run build`

Result:

- all checks pass

## Compatibility and risk

Behavioral impact:

- release process/docs only; no runtime adapter protocol changes

Risk:

- low. Main effect is stricter release CI failures when metadata/checksum guidance is incomplete.
