Issue: #31 - Add VS Code launch/debug smoke configuration for local adapter runs  
Branch: codex/31-add-vs-code-launch-debug-smoke-configuration-for-local-adapter-runs  
Plan reference: /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/plans/ride-protocol.md (developer workflow/testing enablement)

## Summary

This change adds VS Code workspace debug/task smoke configuration for local adapter runs and protects it with scaffold tests that validate config presence and shape.

## Why this change

Developer workflow lacked first-class VS Code launch/task entries for quickly building/running the adapter and smoke-checking integration harness behavior.

## Scope of changes

Files changed:

- /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/.vscode/launch.json
- /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/.vscode/tasks.json
- /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_test.go

Implemented:

- `.vscode/launch.json` configurations:
  - `DAP Adapter Smoke (Go)`
  - `Harness Integration Smoke`
- `.vscode/tasks.json` tasks:
  - `build dap-adapter`
  - `test smoke`
- scaffold tests for config existence/valid JSON/expected entries:
  - `TestScaffold_HasVSCodeLaunchSmokeConfig`
  - `TestScaffold_HasVSCodeSmokeTasks`

## Test coverage

Added top-level scaffold checks to ensure workspace debug/task smoke configs remain present and correctly named.

## Validation performed

Commands run:

- `go test ./... -count=1`
- `go vet ./...`

Result:

- all tests pass
- vet clean

## Compatibility and risk

Behavior notes:

- local VS Code developer smoke flow is now standardized
- config regressions are now caught by CI/unit test runs

Known limitations in this PR:

- VS Code configs are local-workflow oriented and do not assert editor extension availability

## Out of scope

Not part of this PR:

- end-to-end DAP UI automation from VS Code
- remote/container-specific debug profile matrices
