# PR Description - Issue #68

Issue: #68 - Split scaffold tests into domain files with shared helpers  
Branch: codex/68-split-scaffold-tests-domain-files-shared-helpers  
Plan reference: /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/plans/refactor.md (Phase 1: safe structural split)  
Context references: /Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/docs/plans/refactor.md, parent phase #65, parent epic #64

## Summary

This change decomposes the large scaffold test file into domain-focused test modules and introduces shared helpers for common file-read/JSON/snippet assertions.

## Why this change

Issue #68 targets maintainability and readability concerns in scaffold coverage while preserving existing behavior.

## Scope of changes

Files changed:

- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_ci_test.go`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_extension_test.go`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_release_test.go`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_support_test.go`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_helpers_test.go`
- `/Users/stefan/work/lsp-dap/scaffold_test.go` (removed)

### Structural split

- moved CI/build/workflow-oriented scaffold tests into `scaffold_ci_test.go`
- moved extension contract/scaffold tests into `scaffold_extension_test.go`
- moved release/documentation release checks into `scaffold_release_test.go`
- moved support workflow and bundle checks into `scaffold_support_test.go`

### Shared helpers

Added reusable helpers in `scaffold_helpers_test.go`:

- `mustFileExists`
- `mustReadFile`
- `mustUnmarshalJSONFile[T]`
- `requireSnippets`
- `requireSnippetsFold`

## Validation performed

Commands run:

- `go test ./... -run '^TestScaffold_' -count=1`
- `go test ./... -count=1`
- `go vet ./...`

Result:

- all checks pass

## Compatibility and risk

Behavioral impact:

- no runtime/protocol behavior changes; test organization only

Risk:

- low. Primary risk is accidental assertion drift during relocation; mitigated by full suite pass.
